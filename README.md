# Bike Sales Analysis

## üìå Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing customer data to identify patterns in bike purchasing behavior. Using Excel, I cleaned and transformed a raw dataset into a meaningful, interactive dashboard. The goal was to understand what factors influence bike purchases and to visualize these insights in a user-friendly format.

## üîç The Analysis
For this project, I leveraged several advanced Excel features to explore and present the data effectively:

Pivot Tables to summarize data

Pivot Charts for dynamic visuals

Slicers to enable interactivity and filter results based on specific factors

The dashboard helps answer the following key questions:

What is the average income of customers who purchased bikes vs. those who didn‚Äôt?

Which age group is more likely to buy a bike?

(Age was categorized using bins to create clearer group comparisons.)

What is the typical commuting distance for customers who purchased and did not purchase bikes?

The dashboard also includes slicers for:

Marital Status

Region

Education Level

These filters allow for more granular insights into each category.

## üí° What I Learned
Through this project, I learned how to:

Clean and structure messy data for analysis

Use pivot tables and pivot charts to summarize and visualize key trends

Create a fully interactive dashboard in Excel using slicers

Interpret data to derive actionable insights

Overall, this experience improved both my analytical thinking and technical skills in Excel.

## üìà The Conclusion
From the analysis, we discovered the following:

Higher income individuals were more likely to purchase bikes.

Customers in the age group of 30‚Äì40 showed the highest likelihood of buying bikes.

People who bought bikes typically had a shorter commute distance.

Factors like marital status, region, and education also played a noticeable role in purchasing decisions.

This project demonstrates how powerful insights can be drawn from well-structured data and effective visual representation.
